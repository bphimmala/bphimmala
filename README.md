### Hello ‼️

My name is ✨Baipon✨ !! My pronouns are they/she (preference for they, but she is good) and I am genderqueer.

I'm a 3rd year full-time student at UCR. I major in Computer Engineering at Marlan and Rosemary Bounrs College of Engineering.

I'm looking to get an internship in the tech🐱‍💻, computer💻, and/or gaming🎮 field within the next few years. I have a strong passion for all these things and I would like to hone my abilities and improve in any way I can to prepare.

Other passions I have include 🌱environmental conservation🌱 and 🎨art🖊️. I haven't had much time to contribute to these passions recently, but I do hope I can intertwine my love for computers with conservation and art to one day help the future and our planet. 

Though, I will say that AI art "generators" go against my morals and I find them very unethical, as they "learn" how to make pieces through stolen art that the creators feed to the AI. 

I'm mainly focusing on school but would love to contribute to any projects that can teach me anything new!
