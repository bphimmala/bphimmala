### Hello ‼️

My name is ✨Baipon✨ !! My pronouns are they/she (preference for they, but she is good) and I am genderqueer.

I'm a 4th year full-time student at UCR. I major in Computer Engineering at Marlan and Rosemary Bounrs College of Engineering.

I'm looking to get an internship in the tech🐱‍💻, computer💻, and/or gaming🎮 field within the next few years. I have a strong passion for all these things and I would like to hone my abilities and improve in any way I can to prepare.

Other passions I have include 🌱environmental conservation🌱 and 🎨art🖊️. I haven't had much time to contribute to these passions recently, but I do hope I can intertwine my love for computers with conservation and art to one day help the future and our planet. 

🚨 Though, I must clarify that I do not support generative AI. 

The project I'm most proud of is [Frat Rat Redemption](https://github.com/bphimmala/Frat-Rat-Redemption-Official), a text based RPG I made alongside 3 of my classmates for our CS100 final project at UCR.

I'm mainly focusing on school but would love to contribute to any projects that can teach me anything new!
