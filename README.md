### Hello ‼️

My name is ✨Baipon✨ !!

I'm a freshly graduated UCR BCOE student who majored in Computer Engineering!

I am looking to get a full-time position or internship in embedded systems, GPUs, and/or game development. I would like to put my abilities to work to enhance the industry and hone my skills as best as I can.

Other passions I have include 🌱environmental conservation🌱 and 🎨art🖊️. I haven't had much time to contribute to these passions recently, but I do hope I can intertwine my love for computers with conservation and art to one day help the future and our planet. 

🚨 Though, I must clarify that I do not support generative AI. 

The project I'm most proud of is [Frat Rat Redemption](https://github.com/bphimmala/Frat-Rat-Redemption-Official), a text based RPG I made alongside 3 of my classmates for our CS100 final project at UCR.

I am ready to give my time, effort, and skills for projects and jobs that I can learn from! I can be contacted through my email, sabaiponp@gmail.com.
